# Project Name

Image Gallery - React

## Description

_Duration: Weekend Challenge_

The fourth weekend challenge of Prime Digital Academy. The challenge was to use React to create a webpage that contains a gallery of images. To implement and practice conditional rendering, part of the challenge was to replace the image with a description of that image on a click. The images all have their own like count and like button, and when the like button is clicked, the like count updates accordingly.

## Installation

1. Download code from Github
2. Open the folder in an editor of your choice
3. Run an 'npm install' in your terminal
4. Run 'npm install pg' to install postgresql
5. Create a Database called "react_gallery" (using Postico)
6. Using the database.sql code, create a table in the database
7. Run 'npm run server' in your terminal to start the server
8. Run 'npm run client' in another terminal to start the React Server
9. React will open your default browser to localhost:3000!

## Usage

1. Scroll down the page to see all of the images.
2. Click on an image to see a description of the image.
